<b>How to Use a Peak Flow Meter </b>
</h2>
<p>A peak flow meter is a small tool that checks how well you can blow air out of your lungs. It helps you and your care team see how well your lungs are working. </p>
<p>If you have asthma or another lung condition, your airways can tighten and make it harder to breathe. A peak flow meter shows how open your airways are. </p>
<p>Use this tool each day to: </p>
<ul id="l1">
<li data-list-text="•">

</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Help your care team know if your medicine is working</p>

</ul>
<h4>
   To check your peak flow, take your deepest breath possible and exhale as fast as you can.
  </h4>
<h2>
<b>Take Your Peak Flow: Step-by-Step  </b>
</h2>
<p>Always use the same peak flow meter. Try to take a reading at the same time each day.  </p>
<p>For the first 2 weeks, repeat the following process twice a day when you have no asthma symptoms. After that, do it once a day at the same time each day. </p>
<p>1. Stand or sit up straight. Do not slouch. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img alt="image" height="265.9299957275391" src="../../../Images/PeakFlowMeter,Step-by-Step05-29-2025_page2_img2.jpeg" width="354.57338638305663"/></span></p>
<h4>
   The marker at the starting point
  </h4>
<p>2. Set the meter to zero. Make sure the marker is at the bottom. </p>
<p>3. Take in a deep breath. Fill your lungs all the way. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img alt="image" height="216.27786865234384" src="../../../Images/PeakFlowMeter,Step-by-Step05-29-2025_page2_img3.jpeg" width="361.6900245666504"/></span></p>
<h4>
   Lips forming a tight seal.
  </h4>
<p>4. Put the mouthpiece in your mouth. Close your lips tightly around it. Make sure your tongue does not cover the hole where you will breathe. </p>
<p>5. Blow out as hard and fast as you can, like you are blowing out candles. The first big burst of breath is what gives you the reading. Blowing for longer will not raise the number. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img alt="image" height="282.029995727539" src="../../../Images/PeakFlowMeter,Step-by-Step05-29-2025_page3_img2.jpeg" width="366.3416664123535"/></span></p>
<h4>
   The reading here is 375.
  </h4>
<p>6. Look at the number where the marker stopped. </p>
<p>7. Write down the number. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img alt="image" height="234.08001708984375" src="../../../Images/PeakFlowMeter,Step-by-Step05-29-2025_page3_img3.jpeg" width="363.8549659729004"/></span></p>
<h4>
   Write down your number each time. Circle your best for each day.
  </h4>
<p>8. Do it 2 more times, for a total of 3 times. Rest between tries. Circle the highest number </p>
<p>out of the 3. That is your peak flow for the day. </p>
<p>Check your peak flow each morning and evening for 2 weeks in a row. The best number out of all those tries is your personal best. You will compare future readings to this number to check the health of your lungs. </p>
<h2>
<b>How Often Should I Check My Peak Flow? </b>
</h2>
<ul id="l1">
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Check your peak flow daily or as your care team tells you. Morning is best. Try to make it  part of a routine, such as right after you brush your teeth.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Each time you check your peak flow, blow 3 times.</p>
</li>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img alt="image" height="269.9900085449218" src="../../../Images/PeakFlowMeter,Step-by-Step05-29-2025_page4_img2.jpeg" width="359.9866371154785"/></span></p>
</ul>
<h4>
   Markers on the right show the red, yellow, and green zones.
  </h4>
<h2>
<b>Know Your Zones </b>
</h2>
<p>Once you have your personal best peak flow, you will work with your care team to know your green, yellow, and red zones. You can place markers on your peak flow meter to show which zone you are in. You will also write the zones on your asthma action plan.  </p>
<ul id="l1">
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><b>Green zone:</b> Green means good. In this zone, you are breathing at 80 to 100 percent of  your peak flow.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><b>Yellow zone:</b> Yellow is the warning zone. You are in this zone if you are breathing at 50  to 79 percent of your peak flow. If you have asthma, take your rescue medicine, such as albuterol, right away.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><b>Red zone:</b> This is the danger zone. Your breath is less than 50 percent of your peak  flow. Take rescue medicine right away and get to a hospital if you do not get better fast.</p>
</li>
