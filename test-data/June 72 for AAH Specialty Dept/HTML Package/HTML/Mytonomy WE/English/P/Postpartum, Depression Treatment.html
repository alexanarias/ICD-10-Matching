   Treating Postpartum Depression
  </h1>
<p>Postpartum depression, or PPD, is a type of depression that some new mothers can feel anytime from 1 to 3 weeks up to the first year after delivery. It can make you feel sad, or more tired or worried than expected.  </p>
<p>PPD happens to many women. It is not your fault. It is something that your care team can help you treat. The most common treatments are supportive therapy, medicine, or both.  </p>
<p>Please ask us any questions you may have. We want to support you in any way we can. </p>
