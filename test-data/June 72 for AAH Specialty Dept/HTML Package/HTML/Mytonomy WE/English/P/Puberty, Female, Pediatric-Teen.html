   Understanding Puberty: A Guide for Teen Girls
  </h1>
<p>Puberty is the time when your body is growing and changing into an adult body. This means changes in how the body looks and works, including starting periods and growing breasts. Most girls start puberty between the ages of 8 and 13, but it can start earlier or later. Everybody is different. </p>
<p>If you are a teen girl, chances are puberty has already started. Puberty starts when the brain tells the body to make more hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers that help control how the body grows and develops. In girls, the hormone estrogen plays a big role in these changes. </p>
<p>Growing up can be exciting and hard at the same time. You may feel proud one day and overwhelmed the next. That is normal. You are not alone. There are people who care about you and want to help you feel your best. Talk with your care team to get ideas and support.  </p>

<h2>
<b>Signs of Puberty </b>
</h2>
<p>During your teen years, some changes you may notice include: </p>
<ul id="l1">
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><b>Breast growth:</b> Your breasts may keep growing.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><b>Body hair:</b> Hair grows under your arms and on the skin folds around your vagina. You  may also see more hair on your arms or legs.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><b>Skin changes:</b> The changes in your hormones may give you pimples or oily skin.  Sometimes, pimples are called acne. This is common during puberty. If your acne gets worse or does not go away, talk to your care team. They may suggest special creams or pills to help clear your skin.</p>
</li>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img alt="image" height="268.8700042724609" src="../../../Images/Puberty,ForTeenGirls05-30-2025_page2_img2.jpeg" width="403.1276405334472"/></span></p>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><b>Body shape:</b> You may get wider hips and more curves in certain places, like your thighs  or chest.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><b>Body odor and sweat:</b> You may sweat more. Daily showers and using deodorant can  help you feel fresh.</p>

<li data-list-text="•">

This is common. Exercise, like walking or dancing, is a good option for managing stress and mood swings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<b>Menstrual Periods </b>
</h2>
<h3>
<b>Why Do Periods Happen? </b>
</h3>
<p>When puberty begins, each month, your uterus makes a soft lining inside. The brain tells the body to start releasing eggs from the ovaries. The body does this each month to prepare for a possible pregnancy. If a pregnancy is not started, your body does not need the lining. The lining of the uterus leaves the body during a period. It leaves the body as blood and sometimes clots. This is called menstruation. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img alt="image" height="484.3999999999999" src="../../../Images/Puberty,ForTeenGirls05-30-2025_page3_img2.jpeg" width="504.0000160217285"/></span></p>
<h4>
   During your period, a small amount of blood from the uterus leaves your body through the vagina.
  </h4>
<ul id="l1">
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Periods are often irregular at first and may be light or heavy. You may skip a month or  bleed more in some months. This is usually normal.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Some girls may feel tired, have cramps, or feel moody during their period.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Most periods last 3 to 7 days.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Over time, periods usually become more regular and may happen every 21 to 35 days.  You can track them on a calendar or period tracking app.</p>
</li>
<p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img alt="image" height="346.6400085449219" src="../../../Images/Puberty,ForTeenGirls05-30-2025_page4_img2.jpeg" width="302.38796768188473"/></span></p>
</ul>
<h3>
<b>What Does Period Blood Look Like? </b>
</h3>
<p>Period blood can look different each day. This is normal. </p>
<ul id="l1">
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">At the start or end of your period, the blood may be light brown or pink. This is called  spotting.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">During the middle of your period, the blood may be bright red or dark red.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Sometimes, you may see small clumps or clots. These are just bits of the soft lining from  inside your uterus.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">The blood may be thicker or thinner depending on the day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are normal. If you are ever unsure, ask a trusted adult or your care team. </p>
<h3>
<b>Cramps </b>
</h3>
<p>Cramps are pain in your lower belly. They happen when your uterus tightens to push out the lining. Teens may have stronger cramps because their bodies are still adjusting. </p>
<p>This is normal and there are ways to feel better: </p>
<ul id="l1">
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Use a heating pad on your belly.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Try gentle movement or rest.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Ask an adult if you can take pain relief medicine, like ibuprofen, called Advil<sup style="font-size: 0.8em; vertical-align: 0.2em; line-height: normal;">®</sup>  or Motrin<sup style="font-size: 0.8em; vertical-align: 0.2em; line-height: normal;">®</sup>,  or acetaminophen, called Tylenol<sup style="font-size: 0.8em; vertical-align: 0.2em; line-height: normal;">®</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<b>Period Supplies </b>
</h3>
<p>Here are some of the supplies you will need when you get your period. You can decide which option is most comfortable for you. Whichever you choose, make sure to follow the instructions on how often to replace it with a clean version. </p>
<ul id="l1">
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><b>Pads:</b> These are the easiest to use and often the best option for younger girls. They stick  to the underwear to catch the blood. They come in different lengths and thicknesses, so you can pick the ones that are comfortable for you. They should be changed as needed during the day. This can be every 4 to 8 hours or sooner. Some are made extra thick or long to last overnight and help prevent leaks. Some are very small or thin and can be called a liner or pantyliner. They can be used in the days before you expect your period as well as at the end.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><b>Tampons:</b> These go inside the vagina to catch the blood before it comes out. It takes  some time and practice to learn how to use them. Some have a plastic or cardboard “applicator” that helps put them in. Some do not have applicators. Generally, tampons must be changed every 4 to 6 hours. Do not leave tampons in for longer than 8 hours. A rare but life-threatening infection called toxic shock syndrome can happen.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><b>Period underwear:</b> These look like regular underwear but can hold period blood. They  are washed and reused. You can use them on their own. If you have heavy bleeding, these can be used as a backup for a tampon or menstrual cup or disc. You may need 3 to 10 pairs of these for a period. They are easy to use.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><b>Menstrual cup:</b> A menstrual cup is a reusable, bell-shaped silicone or rubber device you  put into the vagina to collect blood before it comes out. Cups come in different sizes. Usually small or standard is appropriate for teens. These can take time and practice to learn how to use and may be better for older girls. A cup can be worn for up to 12 hours. When it is full, it is emptied into the toilet, cleaned in the sink, and reinserted.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><b>Menstrual disc:</b> This works in a similar way to a menstrual cup, but it sits higher in the  vagina. The disc covers the cervix. You insert and remove it with your fingers, which can take practice. Like the cup, the disc can be worn for up to 12 hours. Menstrual discs can be reusable or disposable.</p>
</li>

   Tampons, pads, menstrual discs, and menstrual cups are options for managing your period.

<h2>
<b>Sexual Health </b>
</h2>
<p>During your teen years, you may start to have crushes or feel physical attraction, which is a normal part of growing up. Sexual health means keeping your body safe and making good choices about sex and relationships. Here are some things to know about your sexual health: </p>
<ul id="l1">
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Once you start getting your period, you can become pregnant if you have sex. You can  become pregnant at any time during your cycle, even if periods are irregular. Even if you are not ready for sexual activity, it is important to understand how your body works. Your care team can share resources, such as trustworthy websites, books, or classes, to help you learn about sex and pregnancy.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Talk to your care team about safe sex, birth control, consent, and protecting yourself from  sexually transmitted infections, also called STIs.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">If you are not ready to talk with a parent, you can still talk with a trusted adult or care  team member.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">If you ever feel pressured, scared, or unsure, you have the right to say no. Your body  belongs to you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<b>Mental and Emotional Changes and Getting Support </b>
</h2>
<p>Puberty brings changes in how teens think, feel, and act. This is normal. You may notice: </p>
<ul id="l1">
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><b>Mood swings:</b> Shifts between feeling happy, sad, angry, or excited can happen quickly.  Hormone changes can make your feelings stronger.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><b>Need for independence:</b> You may want more privacy and ask to make more of your  own decisions. You may spend more time with friends than family, and care more about friends’ opinions.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><b>Self-esteem changes:</b> You may become more worried about body image, popularity, or  fitting in at this time. You may compare yourself to others more often. If these things make you feel bad about yourself, find ways to balance them with positive activities and messages. Sports, hobbies, and time with friends and family can remind you of your worth.</p>
</li>
<li data-list-text="•">
<p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><b>Thinking about the future: </b>You may start to consider your own personal goals, beliefs,  and values, and how they compare to how you were raised.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While these mental and emotional changes are normal, they may feel confusing or overwhelming. Most teens do not need therapy or counseling, but if you are very sad, anxious, or confused, talking to a counselor can help. Your care team can give you resources if you need to find mental health care. </p>
