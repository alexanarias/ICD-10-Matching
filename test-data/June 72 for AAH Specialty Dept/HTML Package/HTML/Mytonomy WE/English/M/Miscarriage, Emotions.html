<h1>
   Understanding Emotions After a Miscarriage
  </h1>
<p>A miscarriage is a pregnancy loss before the 20th week. This can happen for many reasons, and it is not your fault.  </p>
<p>It is normal to go through many different feelings after a miscarriage. Grief after a miscarriage may happen right away or days or weeks after. Along with sadness, you might feel angry, confused, scared, anxious, or have a deep sense of loss.  </p>
<p>Some people also feel guilty or alone. Remember, these feelings are normal, and it is OK to grieve in your own way.  </p>
<p>Your care team can give you resources and answer any questions you may have. Please reach out to us. We want to support you in every way we can. </p>
